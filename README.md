Indoor Navigation with ARcore

In today's world, people may not be able to reach their destination in time by getting lost in the building. Although it may be time consuming to find a road with direction signs or signs, it is not easy to find the place we want to reach. This project aims to reach the point where individuals want to go with computer vision within the building as soon as possible. There are not enough products in our country about this case. Many of the products on the market use sensors that work with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signal. These usage types are costly but there may be a lot of error in location determination. In the world, more costly systems are used. The cost is lower since there is no need for any high cost equipment during the development and use phases of this project. At the same time, the margin of error was minimized.
